# Methodology: DocSage - Intelligent Document QA

## Introduction

DocSage is an intelligent document question-answering system designed to extract contextually relevant answers from uploaded PDF documents. The system allows users to upload a document and then ask natural language questions about its content. At its core, the application leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enable intelligent, context-aware document comprehension.

## Core Workflow

1. **Document Upload and Parsing**  
   When a user uploads a PDF file, the system uses `PyMuPDF` to parse the document. This ensures accurate extraction of text from all pages, maintaining the layout and content structure as closely as possible.

2. **Text Chunking and Preprocessing**  
   The raw extracted text is split into manageable chunks using recursive character text splitting. This ensures that contextual boundaries are preserved, which is crucial for accurate semantic understanding. Each chunk is limited to a specified character length with slight overlaps to retain contextual continuity.

3. **Embedding Generation and Vector Store Creation**  
   The split chunks are transformed into high-dimensional vectors using the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` model. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of each text chunk. A FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) vector store is then created to index and store these embeddings, allowing efficient similarity searches during question answering.

4. **Query Processing and Answer Retrieval**  
   When a user submits a query, the system converts the question into an embedding and retrieves the most semantically similar chunks from the vector store. These relevant chunks, along with the original query, are passed to an LLM-powered QA chain (`RetrievalQA` using `HuggingFaceHub` LLM) to generate a contextually accurate response.

## Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each stage—text extraction, preprocessing, vectorization, and querying—is modular, making it easy to update individual components without affecting the entire system.
- **Speed and Scalability**: By using FAISS for vector storage and search, the system supports scalable, real-time querying even with large documents.
- **Accuracy**: Recursive chunking with overlap, and transformer-based embeddings, ensure high-quality semantic understanding and precise information retrieval.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- PyMuPDF for PDF parsing
- Hugging Face Transformers for embeddings and LLMs
- FAISS for vector indexing and similarity search
- LangChain for retrieval-based QA pipeline
- Docker for containerization

## Conclusion

DocSage demonstrates how state-of-the-art NLP techniques can be used to enhance document comprehension. By combining document parsing, semantic vectorization, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the system offers a seamless and intelligent QA experience that is both scalable and accurate.
